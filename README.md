#ðŸ§ª Drug Molecule Generator with Diffusion Model
This project presents a web-based platform that integrates a diffusion model trained on SMILES data to generate novel drug-like molecules. It also features an interactive molecular editor, allowing users to visualize and modify generated molecules seamlessly.

ðŸš€ Features
SMILES-Based Diffusion Model: Generates novel molecular structures by learning from a dataset of SMILES representations.

Molecular Editor Integration: Allows users to edit and visualize molecules in real-time.

Interactive Visualization: Provides a user-friendly interface to explore and manipulate molecular structures.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Diffusion Models: Implemented using PyTorch to learn and generate molecular structures from SMILES data.

Molecular Editor: Integrated using Marvin JS for interactive molecule editing.

Frontend: Built with React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.

Backend: Utilizes Flask to handle API requests and model inference.
